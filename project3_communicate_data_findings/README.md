## Dataset

> This dataset is about the performance of 1000 students in an exam/test. It has 1000 rows and 8 columns/features and I added two extra columns (total_score and grade)
-0 gender
-1 race/ethnicity
-2 parental level of education
-3 lunch
-4 test preparation course
-5 math score
-6 reading score
-7 writing score
-8 total_score
-9 grade

> This data was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams), a public data repository.
There weren't any wrangling done since the data came almost tidy except for the two columns added.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between grade/score and parental level of education, grade and test preparation course. Outside my main varibles of interest, I explored further and found that other variables such as race/ethnicity also affected the grades of students. And also, surprisingly, I found out the grade was some what affected by lunch. 

## Key Insights for Presentation
> Although there was a lot I could have shown for my presentation to share my insights, I focused on the 4 major contributors to students' grades:
Parental level of education<br/>
Test preparation course<br/>
Race/ethnicity<br/>
Lunch (standard or free/reduced)<br/>
So I used a mix of pie-chats, bar plots and scatter plots to show this insights, trends and relationship. I've made
sure to use different color palettes for each variable to make sure it is clear that they're different between plots.
